1. Rust and Tauri Libraries: All the Rust files will share the Rust standard library and Tauri library for building cross-platform applications.

2. Error Handling: The "src/error.rs" file will likely define custom error types that are used across the other Rust files for error handling.

3. Utility Functions: The "src/utils.rs" file will likely contain utility functions that are used across multiple other Rust files.

4. Configuration Data: The "src/config.rs" file will likely contain configuration data that is used across multiple other Rust files.

5. Application State: The "src/app.rs" file will likely define the main application state that is used across multiple other Rust files.

6. Command Definitions: The "src/commands.rs" file will likely define commands that are used across multiple other Rust files.

7. Event Handlers: The "src/events.rs" file will likely define event handlers that are used across multiple other Rust files.

8. Setup Functions: The "src/setup.rs" file will likely contain setup functions that are used across multiple other Rust files.

9. Build Scripts: The "src/build.rs" file will likely contain build scripts that are used across multiple other Rust files.

10. Test Functions: The "src/tests.rs" file will likely contain test functions that are used across multiple other Rust files.

11. Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock: These files are used by all Rust files for dependency management.

12. Tauri Configuration: The "src/tauri.conf.json" file will likely contain Tauri-specific configuration that is used across multiple other Rust files.

13. DOM Element IDs: If the application includes a frontend built with JavaScript, the Rust files may interact with specific DOM elements. The IDs of these elements would be shared dependencies.

14. Message Names: If the application uses a messaging system for communication between different parts of the application, the names of these messages would be shared dependencies.

15. Function Names: The names of functions defined in one file that are used in another file would be shared dependencies.
